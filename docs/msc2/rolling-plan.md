# MSC 2 — Rolling Plan

> ## STATUS: Phase 9 complete — gate reviewed and passed. Phase 10 is ready for PLAN. The exact Phase 9 code candidate `94802fcf85ade8dbf30aaface98cd51cbbb50ec3` passed CI run [32605909026](https://github.com/ctemple9/msc2/actions/runs/32605909026) across macOS, Linux, Windows, and the headless no-GUI job. No live-provider success is claimed where evidence was unavailable.
> **Next move:** PLAN Phase 10 — Bedrock runtimes. The complete Phase 9 step history, amendments, and gate review are in `rolling-plan-archive.md`.
> **Repo:** https://github.com/ctemple9/msc2 · GitHub Actions run [32544701401](https://github.com/ctemple9/msc2/actions/runs/32544701401) is green for exact Phase 8 code candidate `3e04f484bdbee3e821ea55dda6a06cc8e8f5c887`, including repository invariants, macOS, Linux, Windows, and the headless no-GUI link check.

**Previous phases (Setup, Phase 0 through Phase 9) and their amendments have moved to `rolling-plan-archive.md`** to keep this file small. That archive is historical only — current status and active work stay here.

## How this document works

This is the **working state** of the build. The vision documents say where we're going; the port plan says in what order; this file says **where we actually are right now**.

Phases are fixed and come from `msc2-port-plan.md`. **Steps are written one phase at a time**, as we reach each phase — not up front. Phase 10 is now the active planning task.

Each phase runs the six-move loop in `CLAUDE.md`: Plan → Read → Execute → Verify → Review → Advance.

### Step format

Every step looks like this:

```
### P0.3 — Extract TPS parser fixtures
**Status:** not started | in progress | awaiting verification | DONE
**Files:** fixtures/tps/, tools/extract-fixtures/
**What:** Pull the 27 TPS test cases out of MSC 1's TpsMonitoringTests.swift
         into input/expected JSON pairs.
**Verify:** `ls fixtures/tps/*.json | wc -l` → 27
**Commit:** P0.3: extract TPS parser fixtures        <- the message, not a hash
```

Every step also carries a **Batch:** field, telling an agent whether it may be run unattended:

| Batch value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `safe` | Mechanical, and its Verify is a script Cameron has already reviewed. Batch freely. |
| `stop-after` | Runnable in a batch, but the batch **ends here** — the result needs looking at before continuing. |
| `solo` | Judgment work or a new checker script. Run it alone. Its output needs a cross-check by the other agent before the phase closes. |

**Status is only moved to DONE by Cameron**, after he runs the Verify command himself. An agent may set it to *awaiting verification* and stop.

**A step whose Verify only counts things is `stop-after` at best.** Counting proves something exists, not that it is right.

## Phases

Gates are in `msc2-port-plan.md`. This is the map, not the detail.

| Phase | Name | State |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Repo, docs, agent instructions, CI, editor config | complete |
| **0** | Freeze the baseline and build the harness | complete |
| 1 | Domain types and pure rules | complete |
| 2 | API contract and operation model | complete |
| 3 | Safety substrate | complete |
| 4 | Java lifecycle vertical slice | complete |
| 5 | Configuration and migration | complete |
| **6** | Worlds and backups | complete |
| **7** | Server families and provisioning | complete |
| **8** | Mods, plugins, modpacks | complete |
| **9** | Networking and helpers | complete |
| **10** | Bedrock runtimes | **planned — PLAN next** |
| 11 | Desktop and web clients | not started |
| 12 | Terminal UI (deferred from v1) | not started |

## Phase 6 — Worlds and backups

All 51 steps (P6.1–P6.51) are `DONE`, and Codex's gate review (2026-08-18) confirms the gate holds on exact candidate `8568dea`. The full record — scope, characterization, world/backup services, public-client wiring, gate-review corrections, exact-commit tri-platform CI proof, and the review itself — has moved to `rolling-plan-archive.md`.

---

## Phase 7 — Server families and provisioning

All 38 steps (P7.1–P7.38) are `DONE` per Cameron. The final exact candidate is `79d5044` on `phase7-corrections`; GitHub Actions run [32448912726](https://github.com/ctemple9/msc2/actions/runs/32448912726) is fully green across macOS, Linux, Windows, the Phase 7 provisioning/launch smoke, and the headless no-GUI check. The full record — scope, characterization, six-family providers and provisioning, runtime and installer behavior, diagnostics and repairs, review corrections, evidence, and amendments — has moved to `rolling-plan-archive.md`.

---

## Phase 9 — Networking and helpers

Phase 9 is complete and its full step history, amendments, and gate review are
archived in [rolling-plan-archive.md](rolling-plan-archive.md). The exact code
candidate `94802fcf85ade8dbf30aaface98cd51cbbb50ec3` passed GitHub Actions run
[32605909026](https://github.com/ctemple9/msc2/actions/runs/32605909026) across
macOS, Linux, Windows, and the headless no-GUI link check. The approved
loopback-by-default/Tailscale-only management boundary holds, and unavailable
live-provider operations remain recorded honestly.

## Phase 10 — Bedrock runtimes

Phase 10 is the active phase. Its step list has not yet been written; the next
move is PLAN, following the Phase 10 scope and gate in `msc2-port-plan.md`.
