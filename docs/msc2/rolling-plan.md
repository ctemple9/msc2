# MSC 2 — Rolling Plan

> ## STATUS: Phase 11 is in progress — P11.1–P11.14 are verified and DONE; P11.15 awaits verification.
> **Next move:** VERIFY P11.15 with `python3 tools/phase11/help-content-check.py --all`; its status remains awaiting verification until Cameron runs that command.
> **Last updated:** 2026-08-24

**Previous phases (Setup through Phase 10) and their amendments have moved to `rolling-plan-archive.md`** to keep this file small. That archive is historical only — current status and active work stay here.

## How this document works

This is the **working state** of the build. The vision documents say where we're going; the port plan says in what order; this file says **where we actually are right now**.

Phases are fixed and come from `msc2-port-plan.md`. **Steps are written one phase at a time**, as we reach each phase — not up front. Phase 11 is active; P11.1 now awaits Cameron's verification.

Each phase runs the six-move loop in `CLAUDE.md`: Plan → Read → Execute → Verify → Review → Advance.

### Step format

Every step looks like this:

```
### P0.3 — Extract TPS parser fixtures
**Status:** not started | in progress | awaiting verification | DONE
**Files:** fixtures/tps/, tools/extract-fixtures/
**What:** Pull the 27 TPS test cases out of MSC 1's TpsMonitoringTests.swift
         into input/expected JSON pairs.
**Verify:** `ls fixtures/tps/*.json | wc -l` → 27
**Commit:** P0.3: extract TPS parser fixtures        <- the message, not a hash
```

Every step also carries a **Batch:** field, telling an agent whether it may be run unattended:

| Batch value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `safe` | Mechanical, and its Verify is a script Cameron has already reviewed. Batch freely. |
| `stop-after` | Runnable in a batch, but the batch **ends here** — the result needs looking at before continuing. |
| `solo` | Judgment work or a new checker script. Run it alone. Its output needs a cross-check by the other agent before the phase closes. |

**Status is only moved to DONE by Cameron**, after he runs the Verify command himself. An agent may set it to *awaiting verification* and stop.

**A step whose Verify only counts things is `stop-after` at best.** Counting proves something exists, not that it is right.

## Phase 11 — Desktop and web clients

**Gate** (`msc2-port-plan.md` §3): one Svelte frontend is delivered through
both the Tauri desktop shell and the agent-served browser UI, built against
the proven API while preserving MSC 1's information architecture and design
language. `GET /v1/help/{helpId}` resolves the embedded handbook, concept, and
router-guide content, and clients consume that contract rather than carrying
their own divergent teaching text. UI completion never gates headless agent
correctness.

**Working exit criteria:** macOS, Windows, and Linux desktop builds and the
browser load the same generated frontend bundle and expose every Phase
11-owned capability that the connected agent advertises and the calling token
permits. All client state is host-keyed, the current host and active server are
always visible, reconnecting restores bounded console and operation state, and
dangerous actions remain explicit. TypeScript DTOs are generated from
`docs/msc2/api-contract/openapi.json`; no handwritten mirror DTOs are allowed.
The agent serves the same static bundle plus embedded educational content, and
the Desktop/Web column of `client-capability-matrix.csv` is updated with every
surface rather than filled in retrospectively. Browser cookie auth and Tauri
local/remote auth close Phase 11's remaining D-012 scope without weakening
Phase 9's loopback-by-default, explicit-Tailscale-only posture. Linux proof
must launch the real Tauri binary through WebKitGTK under a display server and
interact with it; a Chromium-only browser run is not Linux desktop evidence.
The gate also requires fresh-profile evidence for MSC 1's first-launch
experience: setup sheet, Concept Guide, Handbook handoff, guided tour ordering
and anchors, skip/reopen state, splash playback or fallback, reduced-motion
behavior, and the boundary between agent-owned first-server initiation and
client-owned presentation.

**Extensibility boundary:** navigation and routing are a registry of section
descriptors keyed by stable strings and capability predicates, not a closed
enum, exhaustive switch, or fixed tab array. The route families
`/hosts/:hostId/servers/:serverId/bedrock/*` and
`/hosts/:hostId/servers/:serverId/profiles/*` are reserved without shipping
either screen. A later Bedrock client group registers its sections only when
`GET /v1/capabilities` advertises a usable Bedrock backend; it never infers support
from the host OS or client build. A later player-profiles phase must first port
the ledgered agent workflows (profile loads, Mojang/Floodgate resolution,
manual Bedrock identification, UUID migration/data mutation, hidden profiles,
and skin storage/serving), extend the public contract and capability response,
regenerate TypeScript, then register its section. Phase 11's registry,
host/server-scoped route parameters, lazy section loading, permission filters,
and unknown-capability tolerance are the seam that later phase consumes; none
of that work should require replacing Phase 11 navigation.

**Execution order:** no Phase 11 step is blocked on ownership of `crates/`,
the shared contract, CI, or packaging. P11.1–P11.19 build and prove the common
client foundation and non-Bedrock surfaces. P11.20 consumes the completed
Bedrock capability/runtime-state contract to prove the extension seam without
shipping Bedrock screens.
P11.21–P11.29 may then change shared agent/auth/packaging code and close the
gate. Step-to-step dependencies still apply, and a batch must never continue
after a failed Verify.

**Owner choices confirmed during PLAN (2026-08-22):** general-LAN management
remains unavailable for v1. Browser management stays on loopback or an
explicitly configured Tailscale path, and Tailscale never replaces
authentication or permission checks; Phase 11 does not build a local
certificate authority or ask users to bypass browser certificate warnings.
On macOS and Windows, MSC may download and verify a coordinated desktop,
agent, and compatible sidecar update, but it asks before installation; it does
not silently install automatically. Linux update installation remains owned by
the package manager, with MSC limited to an actionable availability notice.

### Group A — Shared client foundation and non-Bedrock surfaces (in progress)

### P11.1 — Scope the client rebuild from the iOS oracle and capability matrix
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `docs/msc2/clients/phase11-scope.md`, `docs/msc2/audit/msc2-symbol-ledger.csv`, `tools/phase11/scope-check.py`, `docs/msc2/rolling-plan.md`
**What:** Read all 53 copied iOS client files as the primary behavioral and screen-structure reference, then use the MSC 1 macOS views only for the desktop information architecture and visual language. Map every current OpenAPI/WebSocket operation and matrix row to a Phase 11 screen, shared infrastructure, honest future state, or explicitly out-of-scope agent gap. Record the D-003 same-screen rule, D-013 host scoping, D-023 matrix-update rule, D-026 help ownership, D-021 client resource bounds, and the exact Bedrock/player-profile extensibility handoffs above. Do not assign the player-profile agent rows to Phase 11 merely because their old DTOs remain in the frozen baseline.
**Verify:** `python3 tools/phase11/scope-check.py docs/msc2/clients/phase11-scope.md docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**Commit:** `P11.1: scope desktop and web clients`
**Batch:** solo

### P11.2 — Scaffold one standalone Svelte and Tauri client
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/package.json`, `clients/desktop-web/package-lock.json`, `clients/desktop-web/src/`, `clients/desktop-web/static/`, `clients/desktop-web/src-tauri/`, `clients/desktop-web/svelte.config.js`, `clients/desktop-web/vite.config.ts`, `clients/desktop-web/tsconfig.json`
**What:** Create one TypeScript Svelte frontend with a static build suitable for both agent serving and a thin Tauri 2 shell. Keep `src-tauri` standalone from the root Cargo workspace, with its own lockfile and no server-management behavior, so the existing headless Rust workspace does not acquire GUI build dependencies. Establish formatting, type-checking, unit-test, production-build, and bundle-identity commands.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run verify:scaffold`
**Commit:** `P11.2: scaffold shared Svelte client`
**Batch:** solo

### P11.3 — Generate TypeScript from the frozen OpenAPI contract
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/api/generated.ts`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/api/generate.ts`, `clients/desktop-web/package.json`, `clients/desktop-web/package-lock.json`, `tools/phase11/generated-types-check.py`
**What:** Generate the HTTP request/response type surface directly from the current frozen `docs/msc2/api-contract/openapi.json`, preserving optional/additive fields needed for D-010 skew, including `BedrockRuntimeStateDTO` even though Phase 11 ships no Bedrock screens. Make regeneration deterministic and fail when checked-in output differs from the contract. Handwritten transport helpers may wrap generated types, but no hand-authored DTO mirror is permitted.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run api:check`
**Commit:** `P11.3: generate TypeScript API types`
**Batch:** solo

### P11.4 — Build the contract-backed client test harness
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/testing/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/contract/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/fixtures/`, `clients/desktop-web/package.json`, `clients/desktop-web/package-lock.json`
**What:** Add deterministic fake HTTP, WebSocket, upload/download, operation, auth, capability, permission, old-agent/new-agent, and reconnect scenarios using generated DTO shapes. Include unknown optional fields and absent future capability keys so the UI proves additive skew tolerance. This becomes the reviewed test boundary later `safe` screen batches use; it must not invent Bedrock screens or player-profile behavior. The separate P11.20 seam test consumes the real Bedrock capability/runtime-state contract.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:contract`
**Commit:** `P11.4: add client contract harness`
**Batch:** solo

### P11.5 — Establish extensible information architecture and routing
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/navigation/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/routes/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/navigation/`, `docs/msc2/clients/phase11-scope.md`
**What:** Implement the descriptor registry, nested host/server route parameters, permission and capability predicates, lazy component loading, stable deep links, narrow/wide layouts, and unknown-section fallback. Prohibit a closed section enum, exhaustive section switch, fixed tab-count assumptions, and checks such as `hostOs == linux` standing in for capability discovery. Reserve but do not register or render Bedrock and player-profile route families; tests must prove a synthetic future descriptor can be added without editing the shell/router and remains hidden until its named advertised capability is present.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:navigation`
**Commit:** `P11.5: add extensible client routing`
**Batch:** solo

### P11.6 — Make all connection and cache state host-scoped
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/hosts/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/stores/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/hosts/`
**What:** Implement D-013's host registry, minimal host switcher, per-host connection/capability/permission/server/console/operation caches, active-server selection, stale-data isolation, and explicit host identity on every destructive confirmation. Credentials remain behind an injected credential adapter so the browser and Tauri mechanisms can land later without migrating store shapes. No singleton active host, global console buffer, or credential field may leak across hosts.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:hosts`
**Commit:** `P11.6: add host-scoped client state`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.7 — Implement the generated HTTP and resilient stream client
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/api/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/streams/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/operations/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/transport/`
**What:** Build one host-aware transport over generated request/response types, `ErrorDTO`, version headers, capability refresh, bounded staged transfers, and cookie-or-bearer credential adapters. Add console, operation, and notification stream reconnect with bounded history, deduplication, cancellation, terminal-state recovery, and explicit unsupported/old-client states. Keep browser and desktop on the same calls; shell IPC may supply credentials or native services but never an alternative management API.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:transport`
**Commit:** `P11.7: build shared API transport`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.8 — Build the responsive MSC design system and application shell
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/components/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/styles/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/routes/+layout.svelte`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/visual/`
**What:** Translate the copied iOS component structure and MSC 1 macOS design language into reusable tokens, cards, tables, forms, dialogs, alerts, empty/loading/error states, keyboard focus, reduced motion, and responsive sidebar/bottom-navigation shells. Preserve desktop's server-list/sidebar and always-available console concepts without baking today's section count into layout. Include the client-owned first-launch/splash seam needed for the setup sheet, Concept Guide, Handbook handoff, guided-tour overlay, and animation/fallback behavior; do not replace that sequence with a generic welcome screen. The shell must visibly name the selected host and server and remain usable at phone, tablet, and desktop widths.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:visual-shell`
**Commit:** `P11.8: build shared MSC interface shell`
**Batch:** stop-after

### P11.9 — Build fleet, provisioning, and lifecycle workflows
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/home/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/fleet/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/screens/fleet.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Implement status, active-server switching, create/import/rename/delete/EULA, Java family/version/runtime selection and install, templates, start/stop/restart, clear confirmations, capability/permission gates, and durable operation progress. Use the iOS create/import flows as the functional reference and desktop macOS views for hierarchy only. Update each delivered Desktop/Web matrix row in this same step; unsupported or agent-Planned routes stay `Planned`, never implied by a disabled decorative control.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-fleet && python3 tools/phase6/capability-matrix-check.py docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**Commit:** `P11.9: add fleet and lifecycle screens`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.10 — Build console, commands, operations, notifications, and performance
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/console/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/performance/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/components/operations/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/components/notifications/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/screens/live.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Implement the bounded live console with history/search/filter/pause/copy/clear-local-view, command history/favorites, operation progress/cancel/recovery, notification feed, performance metrics/charts, help affordances, and reconnect behavior. Use DOM/SVG/CSS rendering with a low-cost fallback rather than assuming Chromium-only WebGL/canvas behavior. Update the matching Desktop/Web matrix cells.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-live && python3 tools/phase6/capability-matrix-check.py docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**Commit:** `P11.10: add live server screens`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.11 — Build the online roster without claiming player profiles
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/players-online/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/screens/players-online.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Render only the generic online roster the connected agent actually advertises. Do not build the Bedrock allowlist/permissions UI in this phase. Keep the registered section identity distinct from the reserved future `profiles` route; do not call the frozen-but-unimplemented profile, skin, hidden-profile, session-history, UUID migration, or player-data mutation routes and do not present their matrix cells as implemented. Prove the online section still works when profile capability fields are unknown, absent, or later added.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-players-online && python3 tools/phase6/capability-matrix-check.py docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**Commit:** `P11.11: add online player roster`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.12 — Build worlds, backups, and staged transfer workflows
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/worlds/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/backups/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/transfers/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/screens/worlds-backups.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Implement slot inventory/activation/create/rename/duplicate/delete/import/export/convert, direct active-world mutations where the API supports them, thumbnails, backup create/config/delete/restore, bounded uploads/downloads, transactional warnings, progress/cancel/recovery, and risk-appropriate confirmations. Update every genuinely delivered Desktop/Web matrix cell and leave unavailable agent paths visible only as truthful capability explanations.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-worlds-backups && python3 tools/phase6/capability-matrix-check.py docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**Commit:** `P11.12: add world and backup screens`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.13 — Build add-on, modpack, and component workflows
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/addons/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/components/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/screens/addons.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Implement installed add-ons, catalog search, install/update/toggle/remove/source actions, system-component state, client export, modpack inspect/import/replace, and D-027 manual browser-download then bounded staged-upload completion. Preserve provider-unavailable, dependency, pack-managed, cancellation, and provenance explanations. Update the matching Desktop/Web matrix rows; never hardcode provider or server-family lists where the contract supplies them.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-addons && python3 tools/phase6/capability-matrix-check.py docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**Commit:** `P11.13: add add-on and modpack screens`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.14 — Build settings, health, networking, helpers, and access administration
**Status:** DONE
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/settings/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/health/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/connectivity/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/access/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/screens/administration.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Render schema-driven settings without a client-side field enum; implement health cards/problems/repairs, RAM/Java/Geyser, connectivity diagnostics, Playit, DuckDNS, Xbox Broadcast, resource packs, and named-token create/update/revoke with one-time-secret handling. Permission and capability filters must remove unavailable actions while keeping explanations. Agent-Planned files/watchdog/profile routes remain Planned rather than receiving fake screens. Update each delivered matrix row.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-administration && python3 tools/phase6/capability-matrix-check.py docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**Commit:** `P11.14: add administration screens`
**Batch:** safe

### terra clean up

#### Review findings

- The original P11.5–P11.8 foundations were not connected to the running
  shell: it selected hard-coded sections and a hard-coded host/server instead
  of loading the token's permissions and the host's advertised capabilities.
- Reconnecting streams changed label but never scheduled a retry, and staged
  downloads had no client-side memory ceiling.
- The P11.11 roster requested `/v1/session-log` and presented a join/leave
  history even though that route is deliberately deferred with player profiles.
- The capability matrix overstated deferred Bedrock/world and shared-context
  routes as delivered. It also marked live WebSocket channels implemented while
  the shell still reads the bounded HTTP snapshots; those channels wait for the
  authenticated wiring in P11.21–P11.23. A rejected world mutation also
  changed local UI state, and destructive confirmations did not name their
  exact host and target.
- The focused tests covered helpers but did not protect all of those integration
  boundaries against regression.

#### Items completed in this cleanup

- Connect the shell to `/v1/capabilities` and `/v1/me`, use the descriptor
  registry to filter routes, and retain host/server identity in the route.
- Give streams bounded automatic reconnect attempts and give staged downloads a
  512 MiB client-memory ceiling.
- Remove the deferred session-history request and restore its matrix row to
  `Planned`.
- Correct the affected capability-matrix claims, preserve state after rejected
  world actions, name host plus target in destructive confirmations, and leave
  live streams honestly `Planned` until their authentication boundary exists.
- Add regression coverage for the stream/download and deferred-route boundaries.

### P11.15 — Extract and validate the educational content corpus
**Status:** awaiting verification
**Files:** `content/help/`, `content/guides/`, `fixtures/help-content/`, `fixtures/onboarding/`, `tools/phase11/help-content-check.py`, `docs/msc2/clients/phase11-scope.md`
**What:** Extract MSC 1's 31-topic handbook, concept guide, router catalog/records/steps, troubleshooting content, and onboarding copy into the confirmed Markdown-with-YAML-front-matter and structured guide data formats. Preserve source citations and label content versus executable router rules; do not duplicate prose in Svelte. Record unresolved diagram assets honestly. Include the Concept Guide page order, onboarding step content/order, skip/reopen wording, and the source mapping for every first-launch explanation; visual anchoring and animation remain client-owned. Include coverage for every `helpId` already emitted by settings, health, diagnostics, performance, connectivity, and errors, including the `bedrock.runtime-unavailable` later-audit requirement. Add deterministic onboarding fixtures proving fresh-install, already-seen, skipped, reopened, and unknown/future-topic cases.
**Verify:** `python3 tools/phase11/help-content-check.py --all`

### P11.16 — Render contract-served help and guides in the shared client
**Status:** awaiting verification
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/help/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/sections/handbook/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/screens/help.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Build safe Markdown rendering, related-topic navigation, handbook/concept/router-guide readers, contextual `helpId` links, unknown-topic degradation, and client-owned onboarding anchors against the fake contract. Implement and test the fresh-install sequence of setup sheet → Concept Guide → guided tour, including the exact step ordering, user-action pauses, form-card hide/resume behavior, completion state, skip behavior, Handbook handoff, and reopen-from-preferences behavior. Implement the splash animation seam with a bounded fallback and reduced-motion path; preserve the source asset or record an explicit reviewed replacement. Every explanation comes from a response or structured content fixture, never a screen-local copy. The registry must allow future Bedrock and profile topics/sections to appear additively without new shell logic.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-help && python3 tools/phase11/help-content-check.py --client`
**Commit:** `P11.16: render shared help content`
**Batch:** safe

### P11.17 — Prove browser parity, accessibility, and responsive layouts
**Status:** awaiting verification
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/tests/e2e/browser/`, `clients/desktop-web/playwright.config.ts`, `clients/desktop-web/package.json`, `clients/desktop-web/package-lock.json`
**What:** Exercise the production static bundle against the contract harness at narrow and wide widths, keyboard-only navigation, reduced motion, destructive confirmations, host switching, reconnect, upload/download, and deep-link reload. Add a fresh-profile onboarding walkthrough proving setup completion, Concept Guide → tour sequencing, step ordering and anchors, user-action pauses, skip/resume/reopen flags, Handbook handoff, splash playback/fallback, and reduced-motion behavior. Run Chromium plus browser WebKit for fast compatibility feedback, while recording plainly that this is browser evidence and does not replace P11.19's native Linux WebKitGTK proof.

**Status:** awaiting verification
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src-tauri/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/platform/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/tauri/`
**What:** Load the exact production Svelte bundle and expose only narrow native adapters for credentials, file pickers, notifications, menus, window lifecycle, and later agent installation/update. Each native affordance must invoke a shared web workflow with a browser fallback; no route or screen may test `isTauri` to reveal desktop-only management behavior. Keep the standalone Tauri crate outside the root workspace so headless Rust builds do not acquire GUI dependencies.
**Verify:** `npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:tauri-boundary`
**Commit:** `P11.18: add thin Tauri shell`
**Batch:** solo

### P11.19 — Exercise the real Linux Tauri renderer through WebKitGTK
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/tests/e2e/tauri-linux/`, `clients/desktop-web/wdio.conf.ts`, `tools/phase11/linux-webkitgtk-smoke.sh`, `docs/msc2/clients/evidence/`
**What:** On a Debian/Ubuntu desktop runner with `libwebkit2gtk-4.1`, `webkit2gtk-driver`, and Xvfb, launch the built Tauri binary and drive its real window through the native WebDriver path. Verify visible shell, navigation, CSS layout, forms, dialogs, live-console fallback, deep links, one mutating fake workflow, and the fresh-profile onboarding entry path including the reduced-motion/fallback branch; record the WebKitGTK package/version and screenshot evidence. A Vite page opened in Chrome or Playwright's bundled WebKit does not satisfy this step.
**Verify:** `bash tools/phase11/linux-webkitgtk-smoke.sh --native`

### Group B — Bedrock extension seam (ready after Group A; no Bedrock screens)

### P11.20 — Prove capability-driven Bedrock extension seams
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/api/generated.ts`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/navigation/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/navigation/bedrock-extension.test.ts`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`, `docs/msc2/clients/phase11-scope.md`
**What:** Recheck generated TypeScript against the current frozen OpenAPI document and consume its finalized `serverTypes.bedrock` plus `BedrockRuntimeStateDTO` advertisement without hand-written Bedrock DTOs or host-OS inference. Use a test-only future section descriptor to prove Bedrock navigation is absent when unsupported, can be registered when capability state permits it, survives unknown backend/reason values additively, and fits existing layouts/routes without restructuring. Ship no Bedrock section, creation flow, settings, player, allowlist, world, backup, console, or runtime screen in Phase 11; keep those matrix cells Planned for the later Bedrock client group.

### Group C — Shared agent, auth, packaging, and gate work (ready after Group B)

### P11.21 — Close the remaining desktop and browser authentication design
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `docs/msc2/clients/phase11-auth.md`, `docs/msc2/msc2-decisions.md`, `docs/msc2/api-contract/openapi.json`, `docs/msc2/api-contract/auth-scope-phase2.md`, `docs/msc2/lifecycle/pairing-phase4.md`, `crates/msc-api/tests/phase11_auth_conformance.rs`
**What:** Turn D-012's approved mechanisms and Phase 9 posture into one testable contract: same-machine Tauri bootstrap resistant to arbitrary local-process impersonation, per-host remote desktop pairing and secret-store keys, browser pairing-to-httpOnly-SameSite cookie exchange, session revocation/expiry, exact allowed-origin/CSP rules, CSRF tokens for cookie-authenticated mutations, and bearer exemption. Preserve loopback-by-default management and authenticated explicit-Tailscale access; per the owner-confirmed v1 choice above, keep general-LAN management unavailable and do not build certificate provisioning or a local trust system. Use additive versioned routes and `ErrorDTO`; do not put raw credentials in Svelte-accessible storage or URLs.

### P11.22 — Implement browser sessions, origin policy, CSP, and CSRF
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `crates/msc-agent/src/auth/`, `crates/msc-agent/src/routes/browser_session.rs`, `crates/msc-agent/tests/browser_auth.rs`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/auth/browser.ts`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/auth/browser.test.ts`
**What:** Implement the frozen browser pairing/session path on the existing credential registry, with one-use challenges, httpOnly cookies, revocation and restart behavior, exact origin checks, restrictive CSP, CSRF on every cookie-authenticated mutation, rate limits, and audit attribution. Prove bearer clients remain unaffected and a hostile origin/local script cannot turn ambient browser authority into a server mutation.
**Verify:** `cargo nextest run -p msc-agent --test browser_auth && npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:auth-browser`

### P11.23 — Implement local and remote Tauri credentials per host
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src-tauri/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/auth/desktop.ts`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/auth/desktop/`, `crates/msc-agent/src/auth/`, `crates/msc-agent/tests/desktop_auth.rs`
**What:** Implement the chosen same-machine authorization handshake and remote pairing exchange, storing one credential per agent host ID in the platform credential store through the shell so secrets never enter browser storage. Verify local convenience does not become loopback-open authorization, remote credentials obey permission/expiry/revocation, switching hosts cannot reuse another host's credential, and the web build retains its cookie flow with no divergent screen.
**Verify:** `cargo nextest run -p msc-agent --test desktop_auth && npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:auth-desktop`

### P11.24 — Serve embedded help content and port router-guide rules
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `crates/msc-domain/src/router_guides.rs`, `crates/msc-domain/tests/router_guides.rs`, `crates/msc-agent/src/help.rs`, `crates/msc-agent/src/routes/help.rs`, `crates/msc-agent/tests/help_routes.rs`, `content/help/`, `content/guides/`, `fixtures/help-content/`, `docs/msc2/api-contract/openapi.json`, `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`
**What:** Embed the validated content corpus, implement `GET /v1/help/{helpId}` plus the additive handbook/concept/router-guide catalog routes required to browse it, and port the ledgered router matcher/fallback/composer/troubleshooting rules into Rust against fixtures. Explicitly include the `bedrock.runtime-unavailable` topic and its structured unavailable reasons. Return raw Markdown/structured steps for every client to render; unknown or version-new topics degrade through `ErrorDTO`. Do not absorb client onboarding anchors or presentation into the agent.
**Verify:** `cargo nextest run -p msc-domain --test router_guides && cargo nextest run -p msc-agent --test help_routes && npm --prefix clients/desktop-web run test:screen-help`

### P11.25 — Serve the same production bundle from the agent
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `crates/msc-agent/src/web_ui.rs`, `crates/msc-agent/tests/web_ui.rs`, `clients/desktop-web/`, `tools/phase11/bundle-identity-check.py`
**What:** Embed or package the exact Svelte production output the Tauri shell loads, serve hashed assets with correct MIME/cache headers and CSP, support safe client-side deep-link fallback without shadowing `/v1`, and provide an explicit unavailable result when a headless package intentionally omits web assets. Prove byte identity between the browser-served and Tauri-loaded bundles and preserve D-011's no-GUI dependency boundary in the agent.
**Verify:** `python3 tools/phase11/bundle-identity-check.py && cargo nextest run -p msc-agent --test web_ui`

### P11.26 — Install and manage the local agent through the shell
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `clients/desktop-web/src-tauri/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/setup/`, `clients/desktop-web/tests/agent-install/`, `tools/phase11/agent-install-smoke.sh`, `packaging/`
**What:** Add shell-only native commands behind shared setup screens to detect, install, start, stop, repair, and report the platform service and compatible agent/sidecar package. Closing the window must never stop the service or a server. Browser users see the same status/setup route with a truthful instruction/fallback when native install is unavailable; there is no desktop-only screen. Preserve existing service identity, privilege, headless, and rollback rules.

### P11.27 — Define and prove coordinated desktop, agent, and sidecar updates
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `docs/msc2/clients/phase11-update.md`, `clients/desktop-web/src-tauri/`, `clients/desktop-web/src/lib/updates/`, `packaging/`, `tools/phase11/update-smoke.sh`
**What:** Implement the owner-confirmed prompted, signed macOS/Windows update policy as a compatibility-aware set: download and verify release identity before staging, ask before installation, keep the running agent until replacement is ready, preserve configuration/secrets/worlds, pair the exact compatible Bedrock sidecar where applicable, roll back a failed update, and allow app/agent version skew only within D-010's advertised window. Never install silently. Linux defers installation to its package manager and receives an actionable notice, not a second self-updater. Never merge MSC updates with server/loader/add-on update controls.

### P11.28 — Build and exercise desktop and web candidates on all three platforms
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tools/phase11/desktop-web-smoke.sh`, `clients/desktop-web/`, `docs/msc2/clients/evidence/`
**What:** Add production frontend/type tests, agent-served browser smoke, and real Tauri builds to macOS, Windows, and Linux CI while preserving the headless no-GUI job. Exercise the same core workflow in browser and desktop modes; on Linux run P11.19's native WebKitGTK smoke, not a Chromium substitute. Record platform renderer/package versions and explicit unavailable signing/notarization evidence without claiming unperformed release distribution.
**Verify:** `bash tools/phase11/desktop-web-smoke.sh --synthetic --all-surfaces`
**Commit:** `P11.28: prove tri-platform clients`
**Batch:** stop-after

### P11.29 — Reconcile the capability matrix and run the exact Phase 11 gate
**Status:** not started
**Files:** `docs/msc2/client-capability-matrix.csv`, `tools/phase11/phase11-check.py`, `docs/msc2/clients/evidence/phase11-ci.md`, `docs/msc2/clients/phase11-scope.md`, `docs/msc2/rolling-plan.md`
**What:** Check every contract and WebSocket operation against real Desktop/Web implementation evidence, leaving agent-Planned, Bedrock-screen, and player-profile rows explicitly Planned and no cell blank. Prove D-003 bundle/screen identity, generated DTO drift, D-013 host isolation, capability/permission routing, D-026 served-content use, browser/Tauri auth, browser responsive behavior, native Linux WebKitGTK rendering, tri-platform packaging, headless independence, and the exact green CI candidate. Also require the onboarding preservation contract in `phase11-scope.md`: fresh-profile setup → Concept Guide → guided tour → Handbook behavior, step/anchor coverage, skip/reopen persistence, splash playback/fallback, reduced-motion behavior, and honest separation of agent-owned first-server initiation from client-owned presentation. This is Phase 11's only full-workspace run; the other agent decides in REVIEW whether the literal gate holds.
